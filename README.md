##Weather Dashboard

This project had me develop a weather dashboard for people to check weather in a chosen city.  This weather had to give the daily weather as well as the 5 day forecast.  It also needed to have local storage so the user's city choices were saved for them to pick again.

##Here are some screenshots:

Bugs: I had a lot of trouble on this assignment.  I was still working on the 5 day forecast, adding the symbols at the end of the numbers, and the local storage up until the assignment was due.  I had a major issue with my progress on the "daily weather" in javascript showing up on my preview page.
